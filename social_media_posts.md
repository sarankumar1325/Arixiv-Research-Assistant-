## Twitter/X Post (280 characters)

Just launched my ArXiv Research Assistant! 

A retro-futuristic web app that searches academic papers and generates beautifully formatted PDF reports. Think 1980s sci-fi terminal meets modern AI.

Built with Flask, Tavily API, and lots of CRT scanline effects.

## LinkedIn Post (Long-form)

Excited to share my latest project: **ArXiv Research Assistant** 

A web application that combines the nostalgia of 1980s sci-fi computer interfaces with modern AI-powered research capabilities.

**What it does:**
Simply enter any research topic, and the app searches academic sources, synthesizes the findings, and presents them in a beautifully formatted report. The interface features authentic CRT monitor effects including scanlines, phosphor glow, and terminal-style animations.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered academic search via Tavily API
- Real-time report generation with markdown formatting
- On-demand PDF export with Times New Roman typography
- Retro-futuristic terminal UI with amber/cyan phosphor colors
- Responsive design that works on all devices

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- AI/Search: Tavily API
- PDF Generation: FPDF with custom markdown parser
- Deployment: Render

This project was a fun exploration of blending nostalgic design with practical functionality. The terminal aesthetic isn't just for show—it creates an immersive experience that makes research feel like you're operating a sophisticated sci-fi computer.

Here's how it works:

**Tweet 2:**
1/ Enter any research topic
2/ AI searches academic databases
3/ Get a synthesized report in seconds
4/ Export as a professionally formatted PDF

All inside a retro terminal interface with CRT effects.

**Tweet 3:**
Tech stack:
• Python + Flask backend
